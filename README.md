## My process

In this project I started with mobile-first approach. It was fun building this component with knowledge I already had and practice by creating something I haven't done before.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly all the things in this project I already knew but still I taught me to be more careful with component responsiveness. This project showed me that with a small change of CSS and different approach we can have the same effect but with better written code.
