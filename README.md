## My process

In this project I started with mobile-first approach. It was fun building this component with knowledge I already had and practice by creating something I haven't done before.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly all the things in this project I already knew but still I taught me to be more careful with component responsiveness. This project showed me that with a small change of CSS and different approach we can have the same effect but with better written code. Also, to make this component more user-friendly I decided to add short script for mobile devices.

### Useful resources

- [Mobile viewport height](https://dev.to/nirazanbasnet/dont-use-100vh-for-mobile-responsive-3o97) - this article helped me improve app by adding better ux on mobile devices
